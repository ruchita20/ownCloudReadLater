ownCloudReadLater
=================

ownCloud Outreach Program for Women. Building Read Later App for ownCloud.

Here is the broad outline of the design plan for ReadLater App:

Part 1 - Reading articles
—————————————
What are the design goals?
1. Provide a sleek and nice reading experience to show the website/content collected by the user
2. Will not use iframes to display the content snippet

Design issues?
1. How do we layout the app
2. How do you present the articles
3. How do we format the articles

Related resources:
1. Pocket has a browser extension
2. add the reading fucntionality to the app
3. Questions for engineering side? 
—> 
a. As Pocket does, find out what part of the content is text body
b. styling -- easy
c. The difficult part is to scrape the website and then locate the text..
--> do we want to scrape the text and showing it by styling it
--> how to locate the text (either locate the div or tag)



Part 2 - Adding sites
—————————————
Part of basic functionality of the app:
1. add the sites (e.g. NYTimes articles)
2. should the web interface get the whole page or should get the text like flipboard, Pocket, Instapaper 
 

Part 3 - Create browser extension 
—————————————

Part 4 - Android and iOS apps
—————————————

Milestone designation is TBD
